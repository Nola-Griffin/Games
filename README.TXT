Project name: Games
Purpose of project: I decided to make this program for recreational purposes while also retaining my codeing knowledge from my recent
                    AP Computer Science A class that I took. These games are supposed to me small and simple to motivate me to later create
                    bigger projects. 
                    

Additional Notes: 
- Seperate Programming log detailing all of the different changes for each of the classes.
- Each log is ordered from most recent to oldest.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Purpose: To create the baseline to later build the program for adding mutliple games. Setting up the methods and introduction.
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To continue making the Games program for fun, mainly added the ability for the user to input their choice of game.
VERSION or DATE: 07/14/2025 (Version 2)
Important Information: This program was made off of the BlueJ Software so it is not runnable on it's own as an application.
`                      I am not familiar with other softwares yet so I have no idea how the print statements work on other
                       softwares. (If a window where the print statements can print appears)
                       
Changes: 
 - I created a userInput variable in both classes to accept the user inputs for their game of choice.
 - I added a while loop that checks if the user input is appropriate, if not then the program loops through neted if-else-if statements
   until the user inputs a valid response.
 - I added (temporary) output print statements explaining that none of the games have actually been programmed in yet.
 - I decided to change the Outputs Class name to OutputsInputs because the class can also accept userInputs.
 - I created a reusable method acceptInput() dedicated soley to accepting user inputs.
 - I slightly changed the printMenu() method to account for the new acceptInput() method.

Changes: 
 - I provided the skeleton for the program, making a Main Class and an Outputs Class
 - I made the main method in the Main Class
 - I added introductory print statements in the Outputs Class
 - I brainstormed and created a list to output in the printMenu() method of the Outputs Class.
 - I imported the full util package for the Scanner class. I just decided to import the whole package.
 - I create class scanner variables for both classes.
